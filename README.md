# hello-world
This is my first ever created repository where I intend to practicing the GitHub flow so no Judging,  ;)
Certainly! Here's your bio with corrected spelling and incorporating your passion for data science:
I am Moremi Tshepiso, a mathematical statistician passionate about data science. I love the endless possibilities it offers. When you don't find me diving into data, I am either reading political literature, watching the soccer and mostly the English Premier League, or on a hike. I cherish my family and my faith in God.
